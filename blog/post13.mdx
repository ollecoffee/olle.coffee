The coffee was roasted by [Tallat Coffee](https://tallat.coffee), a roaster from Spain.
<br />
A cozy neighborhood café and roastery, driven by a passion for great experiences and exceptional coffee right by the sea in El Cabanyal.
<br />
From the first sip, I was struck by notes of cherry, caramel, and macadamia, gently rounded off with a creamy touch of white chocolate. It was sweet, nutty, and incredibly smooth, complex yet comforting. The kind of cup that makes you pause, savor, and smile.
<br />
In Spain, coffee culture is woven into everyday life. But this particular experience reminded me that when great beans meet thoughtful roasting and skilled preparation, even a simple tallat can become a little moment of magic.
<br />
If you’re ever in Valencia, you’ve got to try a tallat, that’s what locals call a cortado. And this place? Absolutely worth stopping by.
