The coffee was roasted by [Ikori Kofi](https://ikorekofi.com/), a roaster from Valencia, Spain.

For Ikori Kofi coffee is so much more than just a drink, it’s a story of love and care. Every cup is the result of small-scale farmers hard work, passion, and dedication to every single coffee cherry.
Through their hands and hearts, they create something genuine, something that eventually finds its way to your home.
<br />
When it comes to roasting, they aim to honor all the effort that has gone into it. Each origin receives a tailored roasting profile, carefully designed to bring out its unique flavors and aromas. They meticulously inspect each batch by hand, removing any imperfect beans, because only the best is good enough.
Every roast is then thoughtfully tasted and tested to ensure that only those which reach their full potential make it to your home.

I tried a Rwandan brew, and it truly rewards patience. Best prepared with care using the moka method, it allows the crema to fully develop. Take your time to enjoy each layer, appreciate every subtle note, and let it surprise you all the way to the last drop.
<br />
It’s a coffee crafted for those who cherish the art of savoring, where the experience is just as important as the taste.
