The coffee was roasted by [The Fix](https://www.thefixmadrid.com/), a roaster from Spain.
<br />
On a recent trip to Madrid, a welcoming spot called [Masamune Coffee](https://www.masamunecoffee.com) caught the eye. Their shelves were stocked with beans from various roasters, and upon a barista’s recommendation, The Fix seemed too interesting to pass up.
After sampling a cup in-store and loving the taste, grabbing a bag to bring home was an easy decision.
<br />
This batch of The Fix’s coffee hails from Huila, Colombia, and is a washed process. The beans are grown at an altitude of 1,770 meters, the tasting notes include orange, caramel, apple, panela, dried fruits, and nuts.
<br />
Quality and constant evolution guide this coffee. For The Fix everything begins with sourcing top-grade beans, then carefully balancing traditional craft with modern technology to highlight each coffee’s distinct character.
<br />
Time, temperature, and airflow are precisely managed to draw out subtle flavors and aromas, while sustainability remains a key priority—ensuring responsible sourcing and minimized environmental impact.
<br />
The ultimate goal is to create a cup that surprises and delights, sparking continued curiosity and appreciation for all that coffee can be.
