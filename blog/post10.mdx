The coffee was roasted by [Lykke Coffee Farms](https://www.lykkegardar.se/), a roaster from Sweden.
<br />
How do you run a coffee company without hurting people or the planet? That’s the question they asked themselves when they started Lykke, and it’s been their guiding principle ever since.
<br />
They knew they had to do things differently. So they took charge of the entire process -> growing, sourcing, and roasting their own coffee. Their goal is simple: to improve the coffee industry so that even 50 years from now, we can all enjoy an honest, delicious cup of coffee.
But how do you change an entire industry, and why even try? For them, it’s about letting the people who matter most - the coffee farmers - take the lead. They believe that’s the only way real change can happen.
They don’t just work with farmers, they co-own their farms and company together. By cutting out middlemen, they ensure no one is left behind, and nothing is harmed in the process. That way, we can all feel good about every cup we drink.
<br />
For this particular brew, the aim is to bring out as much natural sweetness as possible, which requires a deeper, longer roast. Too light, and the coffee won’t develop its sweetness, too dark, and it loses its distinctive character. Striking the right balance is essential.
These farms are situated in the Caparaó Valley, right on the border of the National Park, where the untouched natural surroundings create a unique microclimate that’s ideal for growing coffee.
