Türkiye is one of the few countries in the world that can claim to have invented its own coffee ritual and culture, a tradition it shares with neighboring countries like Greece.
<br />
Turkish coffee, or Ibrik, has been enjoyed in the region for centuries. It was introduced to Constantinople (now Istanbul) by Özdemir Pasha, the former governor of Yemen, who shared it with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent around 1540.
<br />
Although Turkish coffee is quite different from the coffee enjoyed today, it has played a crucial role in fostering a deep relationship with coffee among the people of modern Türkiye, Greece, Armenia, and other neighboring nations.
<br />
This coffee is a unique anaerobic coffee, with notes of hops and nectar. It is a very complex coffee, with a lot of different flavors that come together in a very interesting way.
You could say it is a coffee that is not null at all, but the taste reminds of rhubarb and strawberry.
<br />
The coffee was roasted by [Null Coffee](https://null.coffee), a roaster from Türkiye.
<br />
Kemal Serkan Araz and Cihan Baspinar founded Null to reconnect people with coffee in its purest form.
Their frustration brewed from quick and convenient consumption, recognizing a growing desire among consumers to reconnect with nature and the quality of their daily products, including coffee.
<br />
Their café is more than just a place to enjoy exceptional coffee, it serves as a hub where leading chefs, mixologists, and coffee enthusiasts come together to share ideas, experiences, and recommendations. By sourcing high-quality coffees and expertly roasting them with a skilled team, Null has become a beacon for coffee lovers in Türkiye.
<br />
I will certainly visit them for my next trip to Istanbul.
