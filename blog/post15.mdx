The coffee was roasted by [Paper Cup Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/papercup.valencia/), an up-and-coming roaster based in Valencia, Spain.
<br />
Valencia isn’t just known for its sunshine – it’s quickly becoming a haven for specialty coffee too. Tucked into this vibrant city is Paper Cup, a new roaster and café where attention to detail meets serious flavor.
<br />
One of their current gems is the Lavado Guatemala. Grown in the southern highlands of Guatemala and washed for clarity, this 100% Arabica delivers a clean, sweet cup. With tasting notes of milk chocolate, caramel, and berries, it’s vibrant yet balanced—perfect for both newcomers and coffee nerds alike. Whether you go with a V60 pour-over or a classic espresso, it shines.
<br />
But what really made my visit special? Their horchata ice latte. A refreshing local twist, it pairs espresso with creamy, cinnamon-kissed horchata for a summer-ready drink that’s both nostalgic and bold.
<br />
If you’re in Valencia, don’t miss Paper Cup. Specialty coffee, a hint of local flavor, and a whole lot of charm.
