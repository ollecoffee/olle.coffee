It was an immense joy to try this coffee. The espresso roast works as a pour over as well as a moka espresso.
The coffee was roasted by [Slowmov](https://slowmov.com/), a reputable roaster based in Spain.
<br />
This coffee hails from the Creativa Coffee District in Panama, where it underwent a brief anaerobic processing method (called Dynamic Cherry),
resulting in a luxurious, creamy texture.
