Indulge in the delightful everyday brew from Huehuetenango in Guatemala. This coffee boasts a creamy sweetness, complemented by hints of cherry and blackberry flavors. The aftertaste is somewhere similar to chamomile tea.
<br />
The coffee was roasted by [Craft House Coffee](https://www.crafthousecoffee.co.uk/), a roaster from the United Kingdom.
Famed for relentlessly striving for sustainability fueled by the elixir of productivity: coffee. Craft House Coffee is at the forefront of the movement towards achieving Carbon Neutral Plus, setting the standard as a roastery.
<br />
At the artisanal wet mill of the producer, this unique coffee undergoes a meticulous process involving depulping and dry fermentation. Following a 32-hour fermentation period, the coffee is meticulously washed and left to sun-dry on the patio for six days.
