This coffee truly takes you on a journey, first you are greeted by a bouquet of wildflowers and a forest of berries, then you are taken
on a trip through peaches, and raisins towards a refreshing splash of watermelon and cranberry as the coffee cools.
The journey ends with feeling like sipping on a cup of black tea with lime acidity.
The coffee was roasted by [Loveless Coffee](https://lovelesscoffees.coffee/), a esteemed roaster from the US.

Loveless the name is a homage to the iconic album Loveless by My Bloody Valentine and a japanese RPG, which is reflected in the tasting notes.
It's a classic washed Kenyan coffee from the Kiunyu Factory in Kirinyaga, boasting classic flavors and a rich heritage
