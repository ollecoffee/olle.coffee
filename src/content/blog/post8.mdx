This coffee is a journey through the tropics, with notes of mango sticky rice, flan, pineapple, and peach. It is a very sweet coffee, with a creamy body and a long aftertaste. It is a very refreshing coffee, perfect for a sunny day.
<br />
The origin of this coffee is from Palestina in Huila, Colombia on the farm Finca El Mirador.
<br />
The coffee was roasted by [Dark Horse Coffee Roasters](https://www.darkhorsecoffeeroasters.com/), a roaster from the United States.
<br />
Natural Hydro Honey process begins when first the coffee is sorted by floating the cherries in water to remove defects, which is followed by hand sorting to remove dark and overripe fruit. Cherries are then dried and fermented whole for 8 days, similar to Natural processing. The dried cherries are then placed in water tanks for 36 hours. During this time the cherries are rehydrated, and sugars are broken down by the water. The coffee is then pulped and moved to raised beds. Here, the coffee will dry 20â€“25 days as Honey process coffee, before finally being milled and prepped for storage and export.
