The coffee was roasted by [Kava Family](https://kava.family), a roaster from Croatia.
The tale of kava intertwines the journey of two individuals bound by love, their cherished families, a circle of insightful friends, a dash of nostalgic childhood reminiscences, and a splash of vibrant hues.
Together, these elements weave the narrative of the family, creating an authentic and heartfelt story.
The coffee shops bear the simple yet evocative name - kava - drawing from the Croatian word for coffee.

The notes of this particular roast are Plum, Jasmine, and Raspberry. It is creamy, balanced and yet so juicy.
It originates from Peru and is supported by the Cedros Cooperative.
