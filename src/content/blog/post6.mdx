This coffee feels like spring, with notes of raspberry and rosewater its almost like a rhubarb soda. It is a very crisp coffee, with a nice acidity and a light body.
The coffee is very well balanced and has a long aftertaste. It is a very refreshing coffee, perfect for a sunny day.

The coffee was roasted by [A Matter Of Concrete](https://amatterofconcrete.com/), an unique roaster from the Netherlands.

It is a colombian rosado from Julián Calderón, a producer from the region of Huila, Colombia. The coffee is grown at 1700-1800 meters above sea level and Rosado as a term refers to the pinkish hue of the cherries.
