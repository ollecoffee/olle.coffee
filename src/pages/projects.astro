			desc="pour.coffee is my detailed guide to pour-over brewing – a slow and mindful way of making coffee that I’ve come to love. Here I share step-by-step instructions, favorite recipes, and the tools that help bring out the best in every cup. I built it to make pour-over feel approachable and fun, whether you’re just starting out or refining your technique. Together with espresso.tools, it’s part of my ongoing journey into the world of coffee – a space to learn, experiment, and enjoy the ritual of brewing."

		<a href="https://espresso.tools" target="_blank">espresso.tools</a> and <a href="https://pour.coffee" target="_blank">pour.coffee</a> are my personal coffee projects – one is a curated wishlist of espresso gear I love or dream of owning, the other a detailed guide to pour-over brewing. <br /><br />
        I built them as a way to document my own coffee journey: the tools I use, the methods I enjoy, and the rituals that make brewing special. Whether you’re here to geek out over machines or learn the art of a simple hand-poured cup, these sites are meant to inspire, guide, and celebrate the craft of coffee at home.
